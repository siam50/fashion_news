                </h2>
                <h6>Differencess between var let and conctent :</h6>
                <p>1. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but
                    not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</p>
                <p>2. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with
                    undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.</p>
                <p>3. var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.</p>
                <p>4. While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during
                    declaration.</p>

                    function?
                </h2>
                <h6>Differencess between regular function & arrow function :</h6>
                <p>1. A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using
                    arrow functions.</p>
                <p>2. Regular functions are constructible and callable. They can be called using the new keyword.But,
                    the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be used
                    as constructor functions.</p>
                <p>3. Arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. The arrow function,
                    on the opposite, doesnâ€™t define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments binding.</p>
                <p>4. Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.
                    However, We can use duplicate named parameters for regular function in non-strict mode.</p>

                </h2>
                <h6>Benefits of template string :</h6>
                <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                    insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in
                    older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic
                    elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that
                    take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting
                    strings to different entities.</p>
                <p>We insert a variable or expression by adding a dollar sign $ and curly braces {} into the string
                    `${variable}`. This is much better than the alternative in old JavaScript where we had to
                    concatenate a string.</p>
                <p>That's why we are using the template string.</p>
